# The Invisible Pulse 

**Translating Plant Biodata into Generative Art.**
*Passion Project - Muhammed Godil.*

## About
The Invisible Pulse is an interactive installation that translates plant electrical signals into generative visuals and sound.

When a visitor touches the plant, changes in electrical conductivity are captured using custom hardware and sent into a real-time system. This data controls organic reaction–diffusion visuals projected onto the plant and evolving ambient music generated in VCV Rack.

The project explores the relationship between living systems and digital media, using plants as a metaphor for how biological life is often overlooked. A future extension of the project introduces the Growth Receipt—a printed souvenir that turns a moment of interaction into a lasting reminder to care for living systems.
